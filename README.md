 <summary><h3>👨‍💻Bahar's Coding Journey:</h3></summary>
    Well, at first I didn't know anything about programming. When I was 12, my mom enrolled me in an online "Scratch" course and I learned about programming and loved it. After that course, unfortunately I gave up programming until about two years later, at the age of 14, I said to myself: Why did I give up programming?! So I decided to start again. I researched different languages ​​and then started learning HTML and CSS. Unfortunately, I did not choose the right course and it took me a lot of time! After about 4 months, I finished learning HTML and CSS and moved on to JS. After about 3 months, I finished the training and start learning  React and I am still learning.
    Because school takes a lot of my time I used to not be able to focus well on learning React, but I finally solved this problem and now I can get to my lessons and school well, and go well on the path of learning programming.
